Change the .env file to a token of your wish, this token will be used for authentication.
make sure the user which runs the API has read access to this file, no one else should have it.

curl request should be - 

for new server - 
curl -X POST http://<ServerIP>:8000/start-new-server/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <.env_token>" -d "{\"username\": \"InGameUsername\", \"version\": \"1\"}"

for adding to whitelist - 
curl -X POST http://<ServerIP>:8000/add-to-whitelist/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <.env_token>" -d "{ \"ID\": \"<WorldID>\",\"username\": \"<InGameUsername>\"}"

Change IP at Server IP , token at .env_token
Basicly everything marked with <> should be customized


I used uvicorn to run the API server, you can use anything you want -
uvicorn API_v2:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
I added this as a service on my host.
